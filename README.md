Short Treasury Bond 

#Risk factors analysis:
Identify all relevant market factors
Perform complete statistical analysis of the factors including
Graphs
Descriptive statistics
Back-testing

#Sensitivity Analysis
Calculate analytical Greeks for all instruments
Calculate effective Greeks (Delta and Gamma) for the Option positions
Perform the accuracy analysis of Greeks approximation by comparing results of Full Valuation to
     for Options position (only for stock price changes)
         Delta, Delta+Gamma, and effective Greeks approximations 
     for Bond position 
         Duration and Duration+Convexity approximations 
For Option: set up an Accuracy Threshold for the Greeks approximations. Determine the accuracy range for each of the tested approximations

#VAR and ES calculations
